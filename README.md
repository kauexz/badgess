# Discord-SVG-badges
All of discord badges as SVG files

PNG convertions are also available but they are very low res, so it's better to just convert them yourself to the resolution you want

Server boosts are only availble for the 9 months version and less as i couldn't the version above. If you find them, please make a pull request.

Here is what all the nitro badges look like:

Also the server owner badges is not stored the same way so it's way less good looking
